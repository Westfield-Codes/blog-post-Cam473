  <h1>Is the NFL scripted?</h1>
  <p>Match-fixing is a very real thing that happens in sports all around the world. But fixing a professional football game would be an enormous undertaking and <strong>there's no evidence NFL games are scripted in any way</strong>—beyond the Super Bowl Halftime Show, of course.</p>
    <hr>
  <h2>Why do so many people think the NFL is scripted?</h2>
  <p>	It’s all just too perfect. It couldn’t be true. They believe the NFL must have conspired to script every moment, every play from last Sunday’s Super Bowl to keep viewers tuned in to the last second and sell as many $7 million ad blocks as possible. At least that’s what a not-inconsiderable chunk of viewers believe.</p>
  <p>Last superbowl, It was the Chiefs versus the 49ers and the Chiefs won and everyone thought it was scripted because of the fact at how many times the refs missed calls for the 49ers which ended up leading to the chiefs winning and on the most important play everybody(but the refs) saw holding on the play from the chiefs online which ended up having the chiefs tie the game up and force overtime which they eventually won in, and also it was for Patrick Mahomes third ring and it was for back to back championships</p>

<p>These examples are between the WWE which is scripted and the NFL which “isn't”.</p>

                  <p>Interesting topic. My main criticisms are that the third paragraph is a run on sentence, and you don't really make any concrete claims about the table you made. The embedded video is also unavailable outside of Youtube.</p>

                  <p>This blog covers a very interesting topic and one that many people often talk about, but how does it relate to you? I think that if you added more about yourself it would make the blog a lot more interesting. The table is a good comparison between WWE and the NFL, but adding more sports to compare it to would strengthen your claim.</p>
